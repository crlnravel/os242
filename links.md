* [Operating Systems](https://os.vlsm.org/){:target="_blank"} ---
  This site contains links to lecture materials, exam questions, and laboratory materials.
* [Bash Scripting Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPwyp2NG-bE&pp=ygUMbGludXggc2NyaXB0){:target="_blank"} ---
  I truly love the channel and the video, especially this one. This video really helps me to learn BASH scripting and understanding my assigments and not just following the instruction, but knowing the meaning of each line Mr. Rahmat gave me! Truly a must watch!
* [Doing C by learning repo](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C){:target="_blank"} ---
  This repository is very cool, though I didn't think I can finish all the projects here, it is still cool to see that I can learn C by applying it into real application. If you already have a decent programming knowledge (and a little bit of computer architecture ^^) it is a really good course to hone your skills! PROPS TO THE REPO CREATOR!
* [Random Cybersecurity Issue Vid from one of my fav Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihtAijebU-M&pp=ygUSbG93IGxldmVsIGxlYXJuaW5n){:target="_blank"} ---
  Here he explains how electrical signals of RAM can be detected to read secret informations, the attack known as RAMBO ~.~. You should check the video yourself IMO, it's so cool.
* [Basic C] (https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/c) ---
  This is pretty cool ig.
